<p>This package contains implementation of Top Tree Query Language. This query language was developed 
specially for Top Tree administration. It contains some basic commands and it is possible to extend 
abilities of TQL by function adding.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<p>For using the language there has to be prepared empty Top Tree. The preparation routines are provided 
by class {@link ttlangs.tql.Launcher} that contains tools for compiling java classes describing the algorithm,
for checking user defined extending functions and for preparing information for TQL working. There is
a list how to initialize TQL:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile java class: {@link ttlangs.tql.Launcher#CompileFiles(String...)}</li>
  <li>Check user defined functions and prepare information about them: 
  {@link ttlangs.tql.Launcher#CheckFunctions(String, String)}</li>
  <li>Create interpreter of TQL:
  {@link ttlangs.tql.Launcher#createInterpreter(String, String, HashMap, String)}</li>
</ol>
<p>Single TQL commands are executed by method {@link ttlangs.tql.TQLInterpreter#execute(String)}. It
does a lexical analysis of the command and then it try to execute it. It is convenient to use the 
method in while-cycle because it returns <code>false</code> until the exit command is used.</p>
<p>Other classes of this package are not public. They are used for representations of parts of commands or
for auxiliary works.</p>
