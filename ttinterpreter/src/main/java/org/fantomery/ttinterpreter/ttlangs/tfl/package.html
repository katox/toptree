<p>This package contains implementation of Top Tree Friendly Language. This programming language was
developed specially for easy designing of algorithms over Top Trees. It contains one public class
that represents the compiler from TFL to Java classes. All other classes are not public and they
are used for auxiliary works.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<p>The only public class {@link ttlangs.tfl.TFLCompiler} contains only public method called
{@link ttlangs.tfl.TFLCompiler#compileTFL(String, String, String)}. It makes a lexical analysis of input
TFL file. During the analysis all information for compiling are prepared from the input and saved inside
the instance of the class. When the lexical analysis is finished then three Java class are generated
and saved into required folder. First generated class describes information stored in vertices,
second informations stored in cluster and third describes an algorithm that will be running over
the Top Tree.</p>
